This twitter bot makes comments and predictions about Bitcoin just as well as your amateur cryptocurrency enthusiast.

(Which may or may not be accurate)

The two motivations behind this project were:

1. Learning how to interact with website APIs using Python
2. Making fun of "crypto enthusiasts" while learning a little on the side

###What I did

To make this python script, I used the tweepy package to post on Twitter and praw to read from */r/Bitcoin* on Reddit.
